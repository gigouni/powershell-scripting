# Powershell scripting

A bunch of Powershell scripts to handle several cases

## Getting started

Clone the project

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gigouni/powershell-scripting
```

Run the scripts by clicking directly on it or by running the script in a Powershell terminal

## Running the tests

_Dude, it's just Powershell scripts..._

## Deployment

Just take the script and run it. Can it be even more simple? No, but at least, it could be the truth.

To run the scripts (if you run the whole script, without copy/paste the content in one of your script), follow the next steps

* Run Powershell as an Administrator
* To be able to run unsigned scripts, run this command and respond Y

```shell
$ # Violent, but effective
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
```

Run your scripts by responding R while running it. If you want to avoid it, follow [this tutorial](https://4sysops.com/archives/powershell-bypass-executionpolicy-to-run-downloaded-scripts/)
